# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
# Game-Rev


Intro
This is a game review  app that allows a user to post game reviews and  view others post

Purpose
I wanted to do something im interested in and i like games and it would be cool to have my friends use and look at it

How does it work
the app starts off at a log in and once you logged in or created an account you can view others post, create your own, edit a post you have, or delete that post. And you can do all that under the my post tab at the top

how was it developed
its made through react and collecting data from a separate api and changing or storing user actions

how to install and run
currently only through me can i access it and i run the server via a terminal and access the website via terminal

challenges faced
learning react was half of it and im not half way to doing that, but i worked hard and used what  i have learned or understood to create this app
